## Excel Class Module with Demo


</div>

### Description

Project includes a very simple Class Module to talk to Excel with a demo project showing how to export the contents of a ListView to a workbook, and then create a pivot table from it along with page setup. The class module is pretty basic but I hope it helps some with ideas of how they can now add Export to Excel options to some of their projects.

NOTE: The end user must have at least Excel 97 installed for this to work.
